Acme::CPANAuthors::CPAN::OneHundred - Remembering our fallen heroes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a hash of CPAN authors' PAUSE ID and name to be 
used with the C<Acme::CPANAuthors> module.

This module was created to capture all those CPAN Authors who have valiantly
submitted their modules and distributions to CPAN, and now have the honour of
currently maintaining 100 or more distributions on CPAN.

please contact me as soon as possible, and I'll amend the entry right away.
